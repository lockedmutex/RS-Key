# Cognitive-complexity ratchet — a regression alarm, NOT a merge gate. Runs in
# deep-checks (daily), the sibling of the coverage floor: it fails when ANY
# non-test function in the crate libraries crosses the cognitive ceiling, so a
# new hotspot trips the moment it lands instead of at the next manual
# metrics.sh pass. It is a ratchet — when a refactor lowers the peak, lower the
# ceiling in the same commit to lock the win in; raise it, with a stated reason,
# only when a function legitimately must grow.
#
# Scope is `crates/*/src` — the host-testable libraries that are the project's
# home for logic and the target of every complexity refactor so far. `firmware/`
# is deliberately out: it is embedded-only glue plus the trusted-display UI
# subsystem (screen state machines that carry inherent, HW-gated complexity),
# whose reduction is a separate effort, not a per-day alarm.
#
# rust-code-analysis is pulled ad-hoc via `nix shell --inputs-from .` (as in
# scripts/metrics.sh and the pages workflow): its version is pinned to the
# flake's nixpkgs so the gate scores deterministically across CI runs, yet it
# never joins the pinned dev shell / SBOM trust base — it only reads source,
# never a shipping build.

# The current crate peak is 31 (PIV general_authenticate, APDU parse); this

# hotspot trips. Ratchet it down as the peak falls.
