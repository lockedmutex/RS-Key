# docs/images

Illustrations for the documentation. Referenced from the `docs/*.md` pages with
**relative** paths (`![…](images/foo.svg)`) so they render both on GitHub and in
the mdBook site.

- Prefer **SVG** for diagrams (crisp, tiny, no theme baked in), **PNG** for
  screenshots, **GIF/APNG** for motion. Keep binaries small — the versioned site
  duplicates `docs/` per build.
- Diagrams are hand-authored and self-contained (their own light card, so they
  read on both the light `rust` and dark `ayu` themes — mdBook embeds SVG as an
  `<img>`, which does not inherit page CSS). Palette: two ramps only — rust for
  the firmware/code, teal for the KV store.
- Third-party screenshots (browser dialogs, `ykman`, GnuPG, …) keep their
  origin noted here.
