Out of the box, RS-Key's at-rest encryption roots in a key derived on the
device and stored sealed in flash. That stops casual key extraction, but a
sufficiently motivated attacker who steals the board can dump flash over
BOOTSEL and grind offline. The production path closes that, in two
independent stages:

1. **OTP master key (MKEK)** — fuse a random 32-byte key into RP2350 OTP
   page 58 and re-root all at-rest sealing in it, then hard-lock the page so
   neither BOOTSEL nor non-secure code can ever read it. A flash dump alone
   is now worthless.
2. **Secure boot** — fuse your public-key fingerprint and the
   `SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE` bit so the bootrom runs *only* images you signed.
   Attacker-flashed firmware (the remaining way to read the OTP key) no
   longer runs.

Each stage is usable alone; together they are the full story. Both are driven
from the host — the firmware never burns a fuse behind your back. The single
exception is the page-58 *lock* row, which physically cannot be written from
BOOTSEL (it lives in a bootloader-read-only OTP page) and is therefore
applied by the firmware on explicit command.

## Stage 1 — OTP master key

What it does: writes a random DEVK (device attestation key) and MKEK (master
sealing key) plus anti-imaging chaff into OTP page 58, ECC-verified, then
locks the page. On the next boot the firmware notices the provisioned key and
**migrates everything already on the device** — FIDO seed, PIV keys, OpenPGP
key wraps, PIN verifiers — under the new root. Your enrolled credentials
survive; that is the point of the migration layer.

```sh
rsk reboot bootsel               # picotool needs the chip in BOOTSEL
rsk otp burn --dry-run           # preview every step
rsk otp burn                     # typed confirmation; keys are generated and FORGOTTEN
picotool reboot -a               # back to the app; migration runs at boot
rsk otp lock-page58              # firmware applies the page-58 hard lock (typed confirm)
```

Facts to internalize first:

- The burn tool generates MKEK/DEVK randomly and **forgets them** — there is
  no copy to lose, and none to back up. The fuses *are* the key.
- After the burn, the **device attestation public key changes** (it now
  derives from the fused DEVK). FIDO/PIV identities survive; the rescue
  attestation key does not — expected, not data loss.
- After `lock-page58`, `picotool otp get` on page 58 fails with a permission
  error forever. Only the secure-mode firmware can read the keys.
- A seed backup (`rsk backup`) made before or after is unaffected — backups
  carry the seed value, which gets re-sealed under whatever root the device
  has.

## Stage 2 — secure boot

What it does: the RP2350 bootrom verifies an ECDSA (secp256k1 + SHA-256)
signature on every image against a fingerprint fused into OTP. Unsigned or
foreign-signed images do not boot — the chip falls back to BOOTSEL, where you
can always drag a correctly-signed UF2 (recovery path).

**The permanent consequences:**

- **Every future flash must be signed with your key.** The dev loop becomes
  build → `picotool seal --sign` → flash.
- **Losing the signing key bricks the board for new firmware** (the current
  signed image keeps booting). Back the key up before enabling enforcement.
- `DEBUG_DISABLE` is burned along the way — SWD is gone (flashing is BOOTSEL
  anyway).

### 2a. Generate a signing key (once, off-repo)

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.rs-key-secrets && cd ~/.rs-key-secrets
openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 -noout -out secure_boot_key.pem
openssl ec -in secure_boot_key.pem -pubout -out secure_boot_pub.pem
chmod 600 secure_boot_key.pem
# BACK IT UP somewhere that survives this machine.
```

### 2b. Sign and prove a signed image boots (before any fuse)

```sh
picotool seal --sign --hash firmware.uf2 firmware-signed.uf2 \
    ~/.rs-key-secrets/secure_boot_key.pem ~/.rs-key-secrets/otp_secureboot.json \
    --major 1 --minor 0
picotool info firmware-signed.uf2        # must say "signature: verified"
# flash firmware-signed.uf2 over BOOTSEL and confirm the device works
```

`seal` writes `otp_secureboot.json` (the boot-key fingerprint) next to the
key. The firmware's image definition is already secure-boot compatible; the
sealed UF2 carries the signature block.

### 2c. Burn, staged

`rsk secure-boot` splits provisioning so every irreversible write is proven
by a real boot before the next, and the only true point of no return is one
bit:

```sh
rsk secure-boot status      # read the current fuse state any time
rsk secure-boot load-key    # 1. boot-key fingerprint + KEY_VALID   (non-enforcing)
rsk secure-boot harden      # 2. DEBUG_DISABLE + glitch detectors   (non-enforcing)
rsk secure-boot enable      # 3. SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE = 1  ← the brick bit
rsk secure-boot lock        # 4. revoke unused key slots + lock the fuse pages
```

Each step has `--dry-run` and a typed confirmation. Between steps, reboot and
confirm the device still works. After `enable`, verify the negative case:
drag an *unsigned* UF2 — the bootrom must reject it and fall back to BOOTSEL;
re-drag the signed one to recover.

### The new flash workflow (forever)

```sh
cargo build --release -p firmware
picotool uf2 convert target/thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf/release/firmware -t elf firmware.uf2
picotool seal --sign --hash firmware.uf2 firmware-signed.uf2 \
    ~/.rs-key-secrets/secure_boot_key.pem ~/.rs-key-secrets/otp_secureboot.json \
    --major 1 --minor 0
# flash firmware-signed.uf2 (BOOTSEL, or: rsk reboot bootsel && cp)
```

## Deliberate choices

- **USB BOOTSEL stays enabled.** It is the only reflash and the only recovery
  path (no debugger), it cannot bypass signature enforcement, and after the
  page-58 lock it cannot read the OTP keys. Disabling it (the datasheet's
  full checklist) would turn every bad flash into a permanent brick.
- **No image encryption.** The code is open source — there is nothing secret
  in the image (secrets live sealed in flash, rooted in OTP). The RP2350 also
  has no transparent XIP decryption; encrypted boot requires fitting the
  image in SRAM, which a ~1.7 MB image does not.
- **No anti-rollback counter.** It would burn a fuse per release; not worth
  it on a hobby board. Revisit if the threat model ever includes downgrade
  attacks.

## Residual risks (still open after both stages)

- **XIP TOCTOU:** the image executes from external QSPI flash; hardware that
  swaps or emulates the flash chip between the bootrom's signature check and
  execution can subvert it. Decap/side-channel-class attack, out of scope.
- A host compromised while the device is plugged in can drive normal
  operations (as with any security key); see
  [threat-model.md](threat-model.md).
