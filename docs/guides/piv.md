# PIV

A PIV smart-card (NIST SP 800-73-4) over CCID: X.509 client certificates,
S/MIME, PIV-aware OS login, SSH and `age` through PKCS#11. Driven with
`ykman piv` or `yubico-piv-tool`; the applet also speaks the Yubico extensions
(metadata, serial, attestation, move/delete, set-retries) those tools use. Note
that `ykman piv` and `yubico-piv-tool` gate on the "Yubico YubiKey" reader name,
which the default RS-Key build (VID:PID `0x1209:0x0001`) does not present — they
need the opt-in `VIDPID=Yubikey5` interop build ([build.md](../build.md)). The
PKCS#11 / OpenSC and OS-native (macOS CryptoTokenKit, Windows) routes below
identify the card by its applet, not the reader name, so they work on the default
build.

Prereqs: on Linux, `pcscd` plus the polkit rule from [linux.md](../linux.md);
if you also use GnuPG, the `disable-ccid` line so `scdaemon` and `pcscd` stop
fighting over the reader. Check the card is visible (the `ykman` commands here
assume the opt-in `VIDPID=Yubikey5` build):

```sh
ykman piv info            # PIV version 5.7.4, slot + PIN/PUK/mgmt-key state
```

## Defaults

| | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PIN | `123456` | 6–8 chars; padded to 8 with `0xFF` on the wire |
| PUK | `12345678` | 6–8 chars; unblocks a blocked PIN |
| Management key | `010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708` | AES-192, the well-known YubiKey 5.7-era default |
| PIN / PUK retries | 3 / 3 | resets to full on each correct entry |

Change all three before real use:

```sh
ykman piv access change-pin
ykman piv access change-puk
ykman piv access change-management-key --generate --protect
```

`--protect` stores the new management key on the card, encrypted under the PIN,
so `ykman` can recover it from the PIN alone (no separate hex string to carry).
The applet accepts AES-128/192/256 management keys; under the FIPS-style build
it refuses to *set* a new 3DES key, though an existing 3DES key still
authenticates so a reflashed device can migrate itself to AES.

> The defaults are public. Until you change the PIN, PUK and management key,
> anyone with physical access can generate, import or delete keys. Treat a
> default-credential card as unprovisioned.

## Slots

| Slot | Role | Typical use | Default PIN policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `9a` | PIV Authentication | system / domain login, SSH, client TLS | once per session |
| `9c` | Digital Signature | document & email signing | **every operation** |
| `9d` | Key Management | decryption, key agreement (ECDH) | once per session |
| `9e` | Card Authentication | physical-access / contactless | once per session |
| `82`–`95` | Retired Key Management | 20 slots for old decryption keys | once per session |
| `9b` | Management Key | admin auth (not an asymmetric key) | — |
| `f9` | Attestation | signs slot attestation certs (on-card) | — |

The signature slot (`9c`) demands the PIN before **every** private-key
operation; the other slots cache the PIN for the rest of the session after one
VERIFY. `9e` carries no special default on this firmware — like the other
non-signature slots it defaults to PIN **once per session**, so a default-policy
9e key still needs one VERIFY before use. For true card-auth / contactless
no-PIN behaviour, generate the 9e key with an explicit `--pin-policy NEVER`.

**Algorithms.** On-card generation and import accept **RSA-2048 / 3072 / 4096**,
**RSA-1024** (disabled under the FIPS-style build, SP 800-131A), **ECC P-256 /
P-384**, and the Curve25519 pair **Ed25519** (signing) and **X25519** (key
agreement) — the Yubico 5.7 PIV algorithm ids `0xE0` / `0xE1`, so `ykman` drives
them as `--algorithm ED25519` / `X25519`. An Ed25519 key generates with a
self-signed certificate like the other curves; an X25519 key is key-agreement-only
and can't self-sign, so generation writes **no** auto-certificate (provision one
from a CA via `ykman piv certificates import`). RSA-3072/4096 keygen is slow on
this hardware (tens of seconds to a minute-plus).

## Generate a key on-card

```sh
ykman piv keys generate --algorithm ECCP256 9a pub.pem   # on-card key, public part out
ykman piv certificates generate --subject "CN=me" 9a pub.pem   # self-signed cert into 9a
ykman piv info
```

Generating in a slot already writes a self-signed certificate into that slot's
certificate object, so a GET DATA serves one immediately even before you run
`certificates generate`. Management-key auth is required to generate.

For a real CA, emit a CSR instead of a self-signed cert:

```sh
ykman piv certificates request --subject "CN=me" 9a pub.pem me.csr
# … sign me.csr at your CA, then import the issued cert:
ykman piv certificates import 9a issued.pem
```

On-card generation means the private key never existed off-device and cannot be
exported or backed up — losing the card loses the key (that is the point). RSA
generation is slow on this hardware (RSA-2048 takes roughly 4–6 s, and the prime
search is random so run-to-run times vary; the device streams CCID keepalives so
the connection stays alive — it is not a hang). See [limitations.md](../limitations.md)
for the measured dual-core figures. EC generation is instant.

## Or import an existing key

```sh
ykman piv keys import 9d existing.pem        # PEM with the private key
ykman piv certificates import 9d existing-cert.pem
```

Import is management-key gated and also accepts RSA-2048/1024, P-256/P-384 and
Ed25519/X25519.
An imported key keeps whatever copy you imported it from — your call which way
the trade-off goes. Imported keys **cannot be attested** (see below): attestation
proves on-card *generation*, which import didn't do.

## PIN and touch policy per key

Both policies are fixed at generate/import time and stored in the slot metadata:

```sh
ykman piv keys generate --pin-policy ALWAYS --touch-policy ALWAYS 9a pub.pem
```

| `--pin-policy` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `NEVER` | no PIN to use the key |
| `ONCE` | PIN once per session (default for `9a`/`9d`/`9e`/retired) |
| `ALWAYS` | PIN before every operation (default for `9c`) |

| `--touch-policy` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `NEVER` | no button press (default for the `9b` management key) |
| `ALWAYS` | a physical touch before every private-key operation (default for generated slot keys) |
| `CACHED` | treated as `ALWAYS` on this device — see below |

Generated slot keys default to **touch ALWAYS**: each sign / decrypt / ECDH
needs a button press, declined-touch fails the operation with `6982`. The
management key ships **touch NEVER** so admin provisioning isn't gated; raise it
with `ykman piv access change-management-key --touch` if you want admin actions
to require a press too.

> `CACHED` is treated as `ALWAYS`. The device has no wall clock, so it cannot
> honour the 15-second touch cache a real YubiKey offers; it errs strict and
> asks every time. If you set `CACHED`, expect `ALWAYS` behaviour.

## Attestation

```sh
ykman piv keys attest 9a attestation.pem
```

Proves a slot key was generated on-device, not imported. The attestation
certificate is signed on-card by the `f9` key (a P-384 CA key, self-signed at
first boot) and carries the standard Yubico OIDs — firmware version, device
serial, and the slot's pin/touch policy. Subject/issuer names are
`C=ES, O=RS-Key, CN=RS-Key PIV …`. Read the `f9` CA cert with:

```sh
ykman piv certificates export f9 attestation-ca.pem
```

Attestation only works for **generated** keys; an imported key returns
`6A80` / `INCORRECT PARAMS` (there is nothing to attest). For the FIDO side of
attestation — org-provisioned enterprise attestation — see
[attestation.md](attestation.md).

## Move and delete keys

`ykman piv` 5.7 can move a key (with its certificate and metadata) between
slots, or delete it:

```sh
ykman piv keys move 9a 82          # 9a → retired slot 82, cert + metadata follow
ykman piv keys delete 9c           # wipe the signature slot's key
```

A key in a retired slot cannot be moved back into an active slot. Both
operations require management-key auth.

## Use it

The card shows up as a standard PIV token; nothing here is RS-Key-specific.

- **PKCS#11** (browsers, VPNs, SSH, `age`): point the app at OpenSC's
  `opensc-pkcs11.so` — `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opensc-pkcs11.so` on Debian,
  `/usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so` on many distros, the Nix store path under NixOS
  ([linux.md](../linux.md)).
- **SSH** via PKCS#11:

  ```sh
  ssh-keygen -D /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so          # print the slot 9a public key
  ssh -I /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so you@host        # log in with it (touch + PIN per policy)
  ```

  For an `ed25519-sk` hardware SSH key the FIDO path is simpler — see
  [ssh.md](ssh.md). PIV-over-PKCS#11 is the route when you need an RSA or
  NIST-curve key, a smart-card-login certificate, or a server that wants a real
  X.509 chain.

- **`age` encryption**: `age-plugin-yubikey` drives PIV slots directly for
  identity files but, like `ykman`, keys off the "Yubico YubiKey" reader name, so
  it wants the opt-in `VIDPID=Yubikey5` build; on the default RS-Key build use any
  PKCS#11-aware `age` build against `opensc-pkcs11.so`.

- **ECDH / key agreement** (`9d` and retired slots, P-256/P-384 and X25519):
  `ykman piv ... ` exposes it (`ykman piv keys calculate-secret` for X25519); at
  the wire level it is GENERAL AUTHENTICATE with tag `0x85`, the operation
  `yubico-piv-tool` and OpenSC use for decryption.

- **Windows / macOS native** smart-card stacks pick the PIV applet up as-is;
  macOS CryptoTokenKit binds its `pivtoken.appex` to the reader
  ([interop.md](../interop.md#piv)).

## At rest

PIV private keys are stored **AES-256-GCM-sealed** under the device root (the
sealed blob is `nonce ‖ ciphertext ‖ tag`, authenticated against the device
serial). Once the OTP master key is [fused](../otp-fuses.md), a flash dump does
not yield key material; **before** that burn the seal's root derives from
on-chip state an attacker with the flash and chip could reconstruct, so at-rest
protection is only meaningful after provisioning (see
[threat-model.md](../threat-model.md)). The seal is bound to the device, not the
slot, so a `keys move` re-homes the blob verbatim — no re-encryption.

## Factory reset (PIV only)

```sh
ykman piv reset
```

Wipes PIV keys, certificates and PINs only; the other applets are untouched.
The reset is **only accepted once both the PIN and the PUK are blocked** —
`ykman` blocks them for you first. To wipe *every* applet at once (PIV included),
use `rsk offboard`, which blocks PIN+PUK then resets PIV as part of a full-device
wipe with a signed receipt — see [fleet.md](fleet.md#offboarding).

There is no `rsk piv` command group: PIV is provisioned entirely through
`ykman piv` / `yubico-piv-tool` / PKCS#11, with `rsk` only involved for a
whole-device offboard.

## Troubleshooting

- `ykman` can't connect → [linux.md](../linux.md) (pcscd + polkit + the
  `disable-ccid` scdaemon note).
- `ykman` stops seeing the card after `gpg` used it → `scdaemon` grabbed the raw
  CCID interface; apply `disable-ccid` and `gpgconf --kill scdaemon`
  ([openpgp.md](openpgp.md#troubleshooting)).
- **PIN blocked** → `ykman piv access unblock-pin` (needs the PUK). PUK blocked
  too → only `ykman piv reset` recovers, and it wipes the slots.
- `ykman piv keys attest` fails with `INCORRECT PARAMS` → the key in that slot
  was **imported**, not generated; attestation is generated-keys-only.
- `change-management-key` rejects 3DES on the FIPS-style build → expected; set an
  AES-128/192/256 key instead.
- RSA-2048 generate takes a few seconds (≈ 4–6 s, occasionally longer since the
  prime search is random) → that's the prime search on this hardware, not a hang;
  the device keeps the CCID connection alive with keepalives.
