# Soft-lock — at-rest seed lock

Optional hardening: with the lock engaged, the FIDO master seed exists in
flash **only** encrypted to a 32-byte key that you hold (as BIP-39/SLIP-39
words or hex). A stolen board refuses every FIDO operation until that key is
presented, even powered up, even running genuine firmware. Your identity
becomes *device + words*, two factors.

This is the same idea as a wallet passphrase. It composes with (does not
replace) the silicon protections: once provisioned, the OTP root and secure
boot ([production.md](../production.md), [otp-fuses.md](../otp-fuses.md))
stop flash-dump and foreign-firmware attacks. The soft-lock additionally
stops *your own device in the wrong hands*.

Needs firmware with soft-lock support (`bcdDevice >= 0x0742`). Older builds
answer `rsk lock status` with "firmware too old". Check with `rsk status`.

![Soft-lock state machine: from power-on the device is Sealed (device-root-sealed seed); rsk lock enable (PIN + touch) moves it to Locked, where FIDO operations are refused and the seed carries an extra ChaCha20-Poly1305 wrap; rsk lock unlock with the 256-bit key moves it to Unlocked with the key held in RAM; a power cycle returns it to Locked and zeroizes the RAM key, and rsk lock disable (PIN + touch) returns it to Sealed](../images/soft-lock-states.svg)

## Prerequisite: a FIDO2 PIN

`enable` and `disable` ride `authenticatorConfig`, which the firmware always
gates on a pinUvAuthToken with the `acfg` permission. So a FIDO2 **PIN must
already be set**, and you pass it with `--pin`. With no PIN configured the
command stops with "authenticatorConfig needs the acfg pinUvAuthToken". Set
one first:

```sh
rsk fido set-pin           # see fido2.md
```

`unlock` is the exception: it needs neither PIN nor touch (below).

## Enable

```sh
rsk lock enable --pin 1234             # PIN + touch gated; typed confirmation
```

Generates a random 32-byte lock key, prints it **once** (default 24-word
BIP-39), wraps the seed value with ChaCha20-Poly1305 under it into flash, and
deletes the plaintext-sealed copy. Touch the device (BOOTSEL button) when
prompted. Treat the key like the backup words: paper, not a file.

Choose how the key is rendered:

| `--scheme` | What it prints | Reconstruct with |
|---|---|---|
| `bip39` (default) | 24 words | the same 24 words |
| `slip39` | Shamir shares (`--threshold`/`--shares`, default 2-of-3) | any *threshold* shares |
| `hex` | 64 hex characters | the same hex |

```sh
rsk lock enable --pin 1234 --scheme slip39 --threshold 2 --shares 3
```

`--key-out FILE` also writes the raw key hex to a `0600` file. A test/CI
convenience, not for production: it defeats the point of holding the key only
on paper.

The wrap is over the seed *value*, independent of the at-rest format tag and
of the kbase the plain file was sealed under. So locking and the OTP
re-sealing ([otp-fuses.md](../otp-fuses.md)) stay orthogonal.

## Daily use — unlock at power-up

```sh
rsk lock status            # locked? unlocked this session?
rsk lock unlock            # prompts for the 24 words; seed goes to RAM only
```

`status` prints four flags read straight from the device:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `sealed` | the one-time backup-export window is closed ([seed-backup.md](seed-backup.md)) |
| `has_seed` | a plaintext-sealed seed is on flash (false while locked) |
| `locked` | the wrapped blob is what's stored — an unlock is required |
| `unlocked` | a RAM copy from this power cycle's unlock is live |

The lock re-engages at **every power cycle**: the unlocked seed lives only in
RAM and is zeroized on unplug. While locked with no unlock this session, the
seed loader fails and the firmware errors out of every credential operation:
registration (`makeCredential`) and assertion (`getAssertion`/U2F) alike.
Browsers show a generic failure and `ssh` says the key refused, until you
unlock.

Unlock takes the key the same three ways and can run headless in a script:

```sh
rsk lock unlock --scheme bip39 --mnemonic "word1 word2 … word24"
rsk lock unlock --key-hex 0011…  # 64 hex chars
rsk lock unlock --scheme slip39  # prompts for shares, one per line, blank to finish
```

Unlock needs **no PIN and no touch**. Knowledge of the 256-bit key *is* the
authorization (it is verified by the AEAD decrypt succeeding). A wrong key
fails closed with `unlock failed: 0x… (wrong key?)` and leaves the device
locked. Unlocking a device that isn't locked reports `device is not locked`.

## Disable

```sh
rsk lock disable --pin 1234            # needs an unlocked session + PIN + touch
```

Disable proves you hold the key by requiring the seed already unlocked this
power cycle, then writes it back plaintext-sealed (device-root-sealed) and
deletes the wrapped blob. If you haven't unlocked yet, pass the key and
`disable` unlocks first:

```sh
rsk lock disable --pin 1234 --mnemonic "word1 … word24"
rsk lock disable --pin 1234 --key-hex 0011…
```

Calling `disable` without an unlock prompts for the lock key (or pass
`--mnemonic`/`--key-hex`). Supply nothing valid and it fails with the lock
still engaged.

## How it composes with seed backup

The soft-lock and the [seed backup](seed-backup.md) are independent (backup
exports/imports the seed *value*, the lock wraps that same value), but their
ordering matters:

- **Back up *before* you lock.** A mnemonic taken before ENABLE still restores
  the original identity onto a fresh board later.
- **Restore is refused while locked.** `rsk backup restore` (firmware
  `BACKUP_LOAD`) returns "not allowed" on a locked device. A restore next to
  a live wrapped blob would leave two competing seeds. `disable` (or a reset)
  first.
- **Export works once unlocked.** With the seed unlocked this session,
  `rsk backup export` serves the in-RAM copy normally (subject to the
  one-time export window).

## Lost the lock key?

Unrecoverable by design. The way forward is a FIDO factory reset, which
deletes the locked blob and generates a fresh identity (`ykman fido reset`,
which needs the opt-in `VIDPID=Yubikey5` build, or any WebAuthn "reset security
key" UI on the default build; see [fido2.md](fido2.md)). Your
[seed backup](seed-backup.md), if you made one *before* locking, still
restores the old identity afterwards. Without it the old credentials
(`ssh ed25519-sk` keys, U2F registrations) are gone.

## Honest caveats

- The flash log keeps the superseded plaintext-sealed record until natural
  compaction overwrites it. The at-rest guarantee hardens over time after
  ENABLE rather than instantly. (That lingering record is still sealed to the
  device root, so this only matters against an attacker who has also defeated
  the OTP tier; see [threat-model.md](../threat-model.md).)
- A compromised host at unlock time cannot read the key from the wire (the
  channel is an ephemeral ChaCha20-Poly1305 tunnel) or the seed (never leaves
  the device). But while the device sits unlocked and plugged in, it can
  drive normal FIDO operations, like any session. Unplug when done.
- The lock protects the FIDO seed only. OpenPGP, PIV, and OATH keys are sealed
  to the chip independently and are *not* gated by it. To gate those, rely on
  their own PINs and on the OTP/secure-boot tier.
