# Seed backup — BIP-39 / SLIP-39

Hardware-wallet-style backup of the FIDO master seed. The 32-byte seed is
exported once, rendered as words, and can later resurrect your deterministic
FIDO identity on a fresh board: every non-resident credential (`ssh
ed25519-sk` keys, classic 2FA registrations) derives from the seed, so after
a restore the same key files and registrations just keep working.

**Not covered** (sealed to the chip, not derivable from the seed): resident
passkeys, OpenPGP keys, PIV keys, OATH accounts, OTP slots.

## Two ways to stay recoverable

Seed backup is one strategy; a **primary + backup device pair** is the other, and
they are complementary:

- **Back up the seed** (this page) — one identity, kept recoverable by its
  mnemonic. Restore it onto a replacement board to resurrect the *same*
  credentials. Simple, but it is a single secret, and resident passkeys / PIV /
  OpenPGP don't come back.
- **Primary + backup pair** ([backup-key.md](backup-key.md)) — two independent
  keys with *different* seeds, both registered on every account. Lose one and the
  other already works — no restore, no shared secret to leak. The cost is
  registering both keys everywhere (and enrolling resident passkeys on each).

Many people do both: two devices *and* a written mnemonic for each.

## Export (once, at setup)

```sh
rsk backup export --scheme bip39                       # 24 words
# or Shamir shares — any 2 of 3 reconstruct:
rsk backup export --scheme slip39 --threshold 2 --shares 3
```

Gates, all enforced by the firmware: an encrypted transport channel, a
**touch**, the FIDO **PIN** (when set) — and the **setup window** (below).
Write the words on paper; the host that runs the export sees the seed, so do
this on a machine you trust.

```sh
rsk backup finalize        # seals the export window — typed confirmation
rsk backup status
```

After `finalize`, export is refused **forever** (until a factory reset makes
a new seed). That's the anti-exfiltration gate: malware on a later host
cannot quietly re-export your seed. Corollary: lost words cannot be
re-exported either — pick a SLIP-39 share count with margin (2-of-3 minimum,
3-of-5 for the paranoid).

## Restore (onto any RS-Key board)

```sh
rsk backup restore --scheme bip39          # prompts for the 24 words
# or: --scheme slip39                      # prompts for ≥ threshold shares
```

Touch + PIN gated. The incoming seed is re-sealed under the *destination*
device's own root — a restored board is cryptographically indistinguishable
from the original for every derived credential. Restore overwrites the
destination's auto-generated seed (it warns; a fresh board loses nothing).

After restoring: your `~/.ssh/id_*_sk` files log in again, 2FA
registrations answer again. Resident passkeys do not come back — re-enroll
those.

## The TUI

`rsk-tui` has the same export/restore/finalize flows interactively (BIP-39
only; SLIP-39 stays in the CLI), with the seed phrase revealed on-screen and
zeroized after.

## Mechanics (for the curious)

The seed crosses USB only inside an ephemeral encrypted channel: P-256 ECDH →
HKDF-SHA256 → ChaCha20-Poly1305, fresh nonce per message. The mnemonic
encodings are entirely host-side — BIP-39 (24 words) and SLIP-39 (Shamir
T-of-N) both encode the same raw 32 bytes, so either reconstructs the seed.
The setup-window flag lives with the seed's lifecycle: cleared when a seed is
generated (first boot, factory reset), set by `finalize`.
