# Enterprise attestation (org provisioning)

Out of the box ordinary `makeCredential` returns `fmt:"none"` attestation (self-
attestation conveys no trust beyond "none" per WebAuthn §6.5.2, and a packed EdDSA
self-attestation breaks `ed25519-sk` enrollment on Windows / OpenSSH 10 — issue
#26; the `fido-conformance` build keeps packed self-attestation for the conformance
suite). RS-Key does carry a per-device self-signed certificate (a P-256 X.509 leaf
with CN `RSK FIDO2`, built over the seed at first boot), but it presents that only
on U2F registration and EA-level-2 requests. An
organization can replace that device cert with its **own attestation key and
certificate chain**, so its relying parties can verify "this credential was
created on one of *our* keys" — the CTAP 2.1 enterprise-attestation (EA) feature.

This page is for the team that provisions fleet keys. If you do not work for an
org that has provisioned yours, it is a no-op: nothing here changes how an
unprovisioned key behaves, and EA is never served unless a managed platform
explicitly asks for it.

## The key + chain model

Two pieces of state make up an org attestation, stored separately on the device:

| Stored as | Holds | Sealing |
|---|---|---|
| `EF_ATT_KEY` (`0xCE10`) | the org attestation **P-256 private scalar** | kbase-sealed, exactly like the master seed |
| `EF_ATT_CHAIN` (`0xCE11`) | the **DER certificate chain**, leaf first (`count ‖ (len ‖ der)*`) | public material, stored plain |

The key signs each attestation; the chain is what relying parties walk back to
your CA. The leaf's public key must match the imported scalar — the device does
not check this (framing only), so a key/chain mismatch surfaces as your own
relying party's first signature-verification failure, not an import error.

## Provisioning

Generate an attestation CA and a leaf however your PKI does it. The leaf's
subject public key must be the P-256 point of the private key you import; only
**P-256 (secp256r1)** keys are accepted — `rsk` rejects any other curve before
it touches the device.

```sh
# host-side, with your PKI:
#   org-att.pem    P-256 private key (PEM)
#   org-chain.pem  leaf cert first, then intermediates, then (optionally) the CA
rsk fido attestation import --key org-att.pem --chain org-chain.pem [--pin …]
rsk fido attestation status
```

`--chain` takes a PEM bundle (concatenated `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`
blocks) or already-concatenated DER. Limits, enforced host-side and again in
firmware:

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Curve | P-256 only |
| Chain size | ≤ 2048 bytes total |
| Certs in chain | ≤ 4 |

`status` is ungated and prints whether a chain is installed plus the
SHA-256 of the packed chain (so you can confirm a fleet is on the right CA
without moving any secret):

```sh
$ rsk fido attestation status
org attestation : installed
chain hash      : 9f2c…
```

To roll back to the factory self-signed cert:

```sh
rsk fido attestation clear [--pin …]
```

## What changes once a chain is installed

- **makeCredential with `enterpriseAttestation` 1 or 2** (sent by managed
  platforms) returns a full attestation: signature by the org key, `x5c` = your
  chain (leaf first), and the `ep` response flag (`true`). With an org key
  installed, **both** EA levels emit the org attestation.
- **U2F / CTAP1 registration** attests with the chain's **leaf** instead of the
  self-signed device cert (classic batch attestation — a U2F response carries
  exactly one certificate, so only the leaf travels).
- **Ordinary makeCredential is untouched** — `fmt:"none"`, no chain, no cross-site
  trackable identifier. EA fires only when the platform sets the
  `enterpriseAttestation` request field *and* `enableEnterpriseAttestation` is
  on (below).

### Without an org chain (the default)

If no org key is provisioned, the request field still has an effect, per the
spec:

| EA level | Without org key | With org key |
|---|---|---|
| (absent / 0) | none | none |
| 1 — vendor-facilitated | self-attestation | full org attestation |
| 2 — platform-managed | full attestation by the **device key** + self-signed `RSK FIDO2` cert | full org attestation |

So a stock key already answers an EA-level-2 request with a real "basic"
attestation — just under its own per-device cert rather than a shared chain.
The device key and that self-signed cert are the same pair U2F register uses.

## Enabling EA on the device (`enableEnterpriseAttestation`)

Importing the key is **not** enough. A `makeCredential` with the EA field is
honored only after `enableEnterpriseAttestation` (CTAP 2.1
`authenticatorConfig`, subcommand `0x01`) has been issued. RS-Key has no `rsk`
command for this — it is the **managed platform's** job (the OS/MDM/browser
stack that drives EA), and it requires an `acfg` pinUvAuthToken, i.e. a FIDO PIN
must be set. `getInfo` reports the current state in the `ep` option, which the
firmware mirrors straight from `EF_EA_ENABLED`:

```sh
# python-fido2, the same library `rsk` uses:
python3 - <<'PY'
from fido2.hid import CtapHidDevice
from fido2.ctap2 import Ctap2
info = Ctap2(next(CtapHidDevice.list_devices())).info
print("ep =", info.options.get("ep"))   # True once enableEnterpriseAttestation ran
PY
```

`enableEnterpriseAttestation` **persists across power cycles** — it is
written to flash (`EF_EA_ENABLED`), as CTAP 2.1 specifies. It is cleared only by
`authenticatorReset` (see below).

## Transport and gating

The P-256 private scalar crosses USB ChaCha20-Poly1305-wrapped on the same
ephemeral-ECDH channel ([MSE handshake](seed-backup.md#mechanics-for-the-curious):
P-256 ECDH → HKDF-SHA256 → ChaCha20-Poly1305) the seed backup uses. The chain
is public certificate material and travels in the clear, MAC-covered by the PIN
token like every subcommand parameter.

Import (`0x09`) and clear (`0x0A`) are gated exactly like a seed move:
**channel + PIN (when one is set) + physical touch** — on this board the touch
is the BOOTSEL button ([build.md](../build.md)). `status` (`0x0B`) is ungated;
the chain it returns is public. Both mutations land in the
[audit journal](audit.md) (`ATT_IMPORT` / `ATT_CLEAR`), and so does an
`enableEnterpriseAttestation` (`CFG_EA`).

```sh
rsk fido attestation import …    # → "touch the device (BOOTSEL) to authorise…"
rsk fido attestation clear …     # → "touch the device (BOOTSEL) to remove…"
```

On the device the key is sealed under the same kbase arms as the master seed,
and the seal tag records which arm wrapped it — so importing **before or
after** the OTP burn both stay loadable. Burn the
[OTP master key](../production.md) *before* importing and the sealed attestation
key is rooted in fuses, not just flash ([otp-fuses.md](../otp-fuses.md)).

## Reset semantics

`authenticatorReset` wipes FIDO user state, but the org provisioning splits
across that line:

| State | Survives `authenticatorReset`? |
|---|---|
| `EF_ATT_KEY` (org key) | **yes** — org-provisioned device identity, not user data |
| `EF_ATT_CHAIN` (chain) | **yes** |
| `EF_EA_ENABLED` (the enable flag) | **no** — wiped with PIN, credentials, counter |

So a factory reset leaves the org attestation installed but **switches EA off**:
the managed platform must re-issue `enableEnterpriseAttestation` before EA
fires again. The reset itself is recorded in the audit journal. Removing the key
and chain is the explicit, gated `attestation clear` — nothing else clears them.

## Privacy note

A shared org chain makes credentials linkable *to the organization* across its
relying parties — that is the entire point of EA, and why the spec gates it
behind both an explicit per-request field and a device-wide enable. Ordinary
(non-EA) makeCredential returns `fmt:"none"` and is unlinkable; the org chain is
served only on explicit EA requests.

## Troubleshooting

- `attestation key must be P-256 (got …)` — the `--key` PEM is the wrong curve.
  RS-Key attests with ECDSA P-256 only; re-issue the org key on secp256r1.
- `chain too large (… B, max 2048)` — trim the bundle. You rarely need the root
  CA in `x5c`; leaf + one intermediate is usually enough, and the leaf alone is
  all U2F can carry.
- `device requires a PIN — pass --pin` (status `0x36`) — import/clear are gated;
  set a FIDO PIN first (`rsk fido set-pin`) and pass it.
- An EA `makeCredential` comes back self-attested (no `x5c`, no `ep`) — either
  `enableEnterpriseAttestation` was never issued (check `options.ep`), or it was
  cleared by a factory reset; have the managed platform re-enable it.
- `import failed: 0x33` — `PIN_AUTH_INVALID`: the PIN was wrong, or its token
  lacked the `acfg` permission. Re-run with the correct `--pin` (do not guess —
  wrong attempts burn PIN retries).
- The import hangs at "touch the device…" — the physical touch never arrived;
  press the BOOTSEL button while the prompt is up, then it completes.
