//! The trusted-display confirmation context threaded through every applet's
//! `UserPresence::request`. It says *what* a pending Approve/Deny prompt should
//! show: a short, trusted, device-controlled `title` plus up to two **untrusted**
//! relying-party fields the screen sanitizes before painting. The button presence
//! backend ignores all of it; only the `display` build's on-screen backend reads
//! it. It lives here, in the crate every applet already depends on, so threading
//! the context pulls no display code into a standard (screenless) key — the
//! fields are borrowed, so it costs nothing when ignored.

/// Which ceremony a confirmation is for, so a richer front-end (the trusted
/// display) can show the right screen. The button-presence backend and the
/// host-test stand-in ignore it — they confirm on a press regardless — so a key
