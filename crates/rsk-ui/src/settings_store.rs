//! `EF_DISPLAY` wire-format codec — the persisted on-device display settings the
//! trusted-display firmware reads at boot and writes when the user edits them in
//! Settings → Display.
//!
//! The block is `[brightness, sleep_secs_be(2), flags]` (4 bytes): the backlight
//! level (`1..=BRIGHTNESS_LEVELS`), the display-sleep timeout in seconds (`0` =
//! Off), and a flags byte (currently only [`FLAG_PIN_DECLINED`] — the user chose
//! "continue without a device PIN" at first-run, so the panel must not re-prompt).
//! The **touch timeout** is *not* here — it persists in the phy record's
//! `PresenceTimeout` tag (shared with `rsk hw --touch-timeout`), so it keeps one
//! source of truth.
//!
//! [`DisplayConfig::apply_block`] overlays a stored block onto a default `self`,
//! field by field, so a record written by an *older* firmware (the original
//! [`CORE_LEN`]-byte block, no flags) or read by an *older* firmware (a future,
//! longer block — only its known prefix is read) survives a firmware upgrade
//! without losing or misreading a field; anything a shorter block omits keeps its
//! current value. [`DisplayConfig::default`] mirrors the firmware's live defaults,
//! so a device with no record behaves exactly as before.
//!
//! Like `rsk-led`'s codec this crate is pure (no `embassy` / HAL), so the format is
//! unit-testable on the host; `firmware/src/display.rs` owns the live brightness
//! field and the `SLEEP_TIMEOUT_MS` atomic and marshals them through here.
