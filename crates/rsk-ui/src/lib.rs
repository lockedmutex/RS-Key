//! The hardware-agnostic UI model for the trusted-display build (`--features

//! touch. It owns no hardware — the firmware's `display.rs` (the ST7789/CST328
//! task) drives the panel and asks this crate *what* to draw and *which* button a
//! tap landed on. Keeping the model here (pure, no `embassy`/HAL) makes the
//! security-critical parts — above all the untrusted-string [`Label::clamp`] that
//! sanitizes relying-party text before it reaches the framebuffer — unit-testable
//! on the host and provable under Kani, exactly like `rsk-led`'s codec.
//!
//! The button geometry ([`ALLOW_RECT`] / [`DENY_RECT`] and [`hit_confirm`]) is the
//! single source of truth shared by the renderer and the hit-test, so a tap can
//! never approve a region the screen didn't actually paint as "Allow".
