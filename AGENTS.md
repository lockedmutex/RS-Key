# AGENTS.md

Operating guide for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, …) working in
this repo. This is the short, imperative version; the authoritative process is
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the codebase map is
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) — read both before a non-trivial
change. If this file disagrees with the tree, the tree wins; send a fix for this
file too.

## What this is

RS-Key is open-source security-key firmware for the Raspberry Pi **RP2350**,
written in Rust (`no_std`, [embassy](https://embassy.dev)), plus the host tooling
that drives it. An RP2350 board is made to behave like a USB authenticator
(FIDO2/CTAP, PIV, OpenPGP, OATH). It is an experimental, single-maintainer
project — see [README.md](README.md) and
[docs/threat-model.md](docs/threat-model.md).

## Golden rules

- **The gate is the source of truth.** Run `nix develop -c ./scripts/check.sh`
  and make it fully green before you call a change done. Don't infer success
  from a partial build — CI runs exactly this script, so green locally is the
  whole bar.
- **Bump `bcdDevice` on a firmware-behaviour change.** `config.device_release`
  in [firmware/src/main.rs](firmware/src/main.rs), +1 hex. Host-only changes
  (CLI, docs, CI) do **not** bump it. (Background, plus the separate
  anti-rollback epoch it must not be confused with: CONTRIBUTING.md →
  "Firmware changes bump bcdDevice".)
- **`no_std`, no alloc.** If a firmware change needs a heap, it's the wrong
  change. Clippy runs `-D warnings`; justify any `#[allow]` inline at the
  smallest scope.
- **`unsafe` and new dependencies are not free.** A new `unsafe` site needs an
  entry in [docs/unsafe.md](docs/unsafe.md); a new dependency needs a stated
  reason — it's joining an authenticator's trust base.
- **Every new file starts with the SPDX header** (`AGPL-3.0-only` — copy it from
  any neighbouring source file).
- **Don't commit, push, flash, sign, or write OTP fuses unless asked.** The
  maintainer owns git history and everything that touches hardware (see
  "Maintainer-only"). When you do commit on request, do it from inside
  `nix develop` — a pre-commit hook (gitleaks + fmt + clippy) rejects commits
  made outside the shell.
- **Commits follow the repo's prefix style** — see `git log` and CONTRIBUTING.md
  → "Commits and PRs". History reads as a changelog; one topic per change, with
  refactors kept separate from behaviour changes.

## Working discipline

- **Surface assumptions; don't code through confusion.** If the task has several
  reasonable readings or an important detail is unclear, say so and ask before
  writing code. State the assumptions the implementation depends on.
- **Surgical diffs.** Touch only what the task requires; no refactoring adjacent
  code "while you're there". Unrelated dead code or design problems: mention
  them separately, don't fold them into the diff.
- **Define done as something checkable.** A bug fix starts by reproducing the
  bug — a failing host test where the logic is host-testable, a `tests/*.py`
  repro otherwise — then fixes it. A refactor preserves behaviour and proves it
  with the existing tests and an unchanged wire surface. For multi-step work,
  each step names its verification.
- **Never report unverified success.** Don't claim a fix works, a command
  succeeded, or the gate is green unless you observed it. If something couldn't
  be verified (e.g. it needs hardware), say exactly what remains unchecked.

## Code style

Match the file you're editing — naming, error-handling pattern, and comment
density included. New code should be indistinguishable from what surrounds it,
not stamped with a different house style. Then:

- **Comments earn their place.** Explain *why*, never *what* — the reader can see
  what the line does. **A comment is at most 3 lines**; if it needs more, fix the
  code or the design, not the comment. No narrating the obvious
  (`// loop over the items`), no commented-out code left behind, no changelog
  prose, no `// this function will …` preambles. Worth words: a constraint, a
  spec reference (`// CTAP 2.1 §6.5.5.7`), power-cut ordering, a why-this-not-that.
- **Smallest surface that works (KISS, YAGNI).** Focused functions; the
  iterator/idiom the neighbours already use; no trait, generic, or config knob
  for a future that isn't here yet. If the same result takes materially less
  code, choose the smaller solution. But simple ≠ incomplete: a "simple" change
  still satisfies the whole current contract — every affected layer, state,
  test, and doc (see "When you change X, also do Y") — not an MVP slice of it.
- **Names carry the domain vocabulary** (`rpIdHash`, `KeyFid`, `bcdDevice`), not
  invented synonyms.
- **No magic values; define once, reuse (DRY).** Anything protocol- or
  policy-shaped — an INS or tag, a FID, a timeout, a retry budget, a buffer
  size — is defined once under a domain name and reused (pattern:
  `crates/rsk-fido/src/consts.rs`); the same goes for duplicated status/label
  mappings. Self-evident literals in place (`0`, `1`, an obvious length) are fine.
- **Typed state, not string matching.** Control flow follows enums and typed
  states, never display text or ad-hoc literal comparison. A flow with more than
  3–4 states, retries, or cancellation gets an explicit state machine kept
  separate from transport and rendering, with its invalid transitions tested.
- **No hidden side effects.** A function named like `get`/`parse`/`validate`/
  `format` must not write flash, mutate state, or do I/O; if it must, make that
  visible in its name and at the call site.
- **Fail explicitly.** Don't swallow errors into vague fallbacks; map a failure
  to the status word or error variant that preserves the cause. An intentional
  fallback is named, scoped, and tested.
- **Don't grow oversized files.** A sizeable new unit (a command handler, a
  screen, a codec) goes in its own module — or a `crates/rsk-*` crate if it's
  host-testable — not appended to an already-long file. Split an oversized file
  along existing applet/command/screen boundaries only when a task touches it,
  as its own refactor commit; never split just to hit a line count.
- **UI text is presentation only** (`rsk-ui`, `tools/tui`, `tools/rsk`): map
  typed state to text at the edge, never branch on a display string, and keep
  each domain's status→label/colour mapping in one place.

The rest — `no_std`/no-alloc, `-D warnings`, `unsafe`, new dependencies, the
Python conventions for `tools/rsk` — is in the Golden rules above and
CONTRIBUTING.md → "Code".

## Build & test

- **Everything runs inside `nix develop`** (it pins Rust stable + the
  `thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf` target, picotool, gitleaks, the Python stack).
  Prefix one-off commands with `nix develop -c …`.
- **The default cargo target is the firmware's `thumbv8m` (embedded).** Host
  clippy and tests need an explicit `--target <host triple>` — `check.sh` has
  the exact invocations. On Linux, run
  `HOST_TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu ./scripts/check.sh`.
- **`firmware/` is a `no_std` binary with embassy-rp (RP2350) deps — it does NOT
  build or test on the host.** So host-testable logic belongs in a `crates/`
  lib, not in `firmware/`. When you add logic worth unit-testing (a parser, a
  codec, a state machine), put it in a `crates/rsk-*` crate with `#[cfg(test)]`
  tests — and a `#[cfg(kani)]` proof where a round-trip or invariant warrants
  one — and keep `firmware/` as the thin glue that calls it. Worked example: the
  `EF_LED_CONF` codec lives in `crates/rsk-led` (host-tested + Kani); `led.rs`
  only marshals its atomics through it.
- **Tests and Kani proofs live in sibling files, not inline.** Don't grow
  `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { … }` / `#[cfg(kani)] mod proofs { … }` blocks at the
  bottom of a source file — keep the code file to code and hook the modules in
  by path:

  ```rust
  #[cfg(test)]
  #[path = "foo_tests.rs"]
  mod tests;

  #[cfg(kani)]
  #[path = "foo_kani.rs"]
  mod proofs;
  ```

  `foo_tests.rs` / `foo_kani.rs` sit next to `foo.rs`; a crate root (`lib.rs`)
  uses `tests.rs` / `kani.rs` (worked example: `crates/rsk-slip39/src/tests.rs`).
  Each starts with the SPDX header and `use super::*;`. The `#[path]`
  child-module form is deliberate: it keeps the tests' access to the parent's
  private items, which a plain sibling `mod` would lose. cfg-gated code never
  reaches the firmware image, so moving it is not a behaviour change (no
  `bcdDevice` bump).
- **`check.sh` leaves the *no-touch* test image** at
  `target/.../release/firmware`. Anything meant to be flashed must be rebuilt
  with `cargo build --release -p firmware` first — flag this if your change
  affects which image is produced.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `firmware/` | The binary: boot, USB, applet wiring, LED, presence. `no_std`, embedded-only. |
| `crates/rsk-*` | The libraries (fido, piv, openpgp, oath, otp, mgmt, fs, crypto, rescue, sdk, usb, led, rsa-asm). Host-tested. |
| `tools/rsk/` | The Python host CLI (`rsk …`). Match the neighbouring modules: `register(sub)`, `die()`, flake-provided deps (no pip). |
| `tools/tui/` | The Rust TUI cockpit — **its own workspace** (build/clippy/test via its own manifest). |
| `docs/` | mdBook (`SUMMARY.md` = nav). [`docs/protocol.md`](docs/protocol.md) is the **third-party / PicoForge wire spec** — keep it in sync when a wire format changes. |
| `fuzz/` | Fuzz targets (nightly, own workspace): `nix develop .#fuzz -c cargo fuzz run <target>`. |
| `tests/*.py` | On-device tests, run by hand against a no-touch board. |

Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the boot flow, crate graph,
flash layout, and device identity.

## When you change X, also do Y

- **A wire format / the protocol surface** (`EF_LED_CONF`, the phy record
  `EF_PHY`, an applet APDU, a CTAP map) → update
  [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md), the host tool that speaks it
  (`tools/rsk/…`), and add a `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` entry. A
  persistent-flash change must keep an already-provisioned device working across
  the upgrade — say how, and load older record layouts forward-compatibly.
- **User-visible behaviour** → the matching `docs/guides/*.md` and a CHANGELOG
  `[Unreleased]` entry.
- **A `tools/rsk` (Python CLI) or `tools/tui` (Rust TUI) change** → bump that
  package's version (`tools/rsk/__init__.py` `__version__` /
  `tools/tui/Cargo.toml` `version`). It's the host-tool analog of the bcdDevice
  bump: `pipx` / `pip` / a published `uvx` install key off the version, so an
  unbumped change leaves those users on a **stale build** (e.g. an old `rsk led`
  silently mis-parsing a new device's config). For local dev, run current source
  with `uv run --project tools rsk …` (or `nix develop` → `rsk`) — NOT
  `uvx --from tools/`, which caches the built env regardless of the version
  (`uv cache clean` busts it if you must).
- **A new `unsafe` site** → [docs/unsafe.md](docs/unsafe.md).
- **Anything protocol-visible** → a test at the level it's visible: a host test
  if the logic is host-testable, a `tests/*.py` script if only the USB stack
  exercises it.

## Maintainer-only — do not attempt

- **Flashing, secure-boot signing, and OTP fuse writes.** Irreversible and
  key-dependent: propose the change, never perform it. The anti-rollback epoch
  (`picotool seal --rollback N`) is a release-time decision, not a code edit.
- **Pushing and tagging.** Leave `git push`, release tags, and the release
  pipeline to the maintainer.
- **Bumping the embassy / toolchain pins**, or weakening the gate, the at-rest
  seals, or a threat-model assumption — only with the maintainer's explicit
  say-so, and flag it loudly in the PR.
