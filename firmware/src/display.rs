//! The trusted-display backend for the `display` build: it drives the Waveshare
//! RP2350-Touch-LCD-2.8 (ST7789 over SPI1, CST328 touch over I2C1) and is the
//! `display` build's [`crate::presence::Presence`]. Two roles share one panel:
//!
//! * [`status_task`] mirrors the device status the onboard LED would show (boot /
//!   idle / working), repainting on change — the ambient screen.
//! * [`TouchPresence`] renders the trusted Approve/Deny prompt when an applet asks
//!   for user presence, naming the operation and the *real* relying party, and
//!   block-waits an on-screen tap. A tap on **Allow** confirms; a tap on **Deny**
//!   is a genuine `Declined` (→ `OPERATION_DENIED`) — the BOOTSEL button has no
//!   such gesture. This is the anti-WebUSB-phishing guarantee: a signature can't
//!   be obtained without a physical tap on a screen showing the true rp.
//!
//! The *what to draw*, the untrusted-string sanitizing, the Allow/Deny button
//! geometry and the touch-report parse all live in `rsk-ui` (host-tested + Kani);
//! this file is the thin HAL glue plus the cross-executor wait.
//!
//! Both roles run on the THREAD executor and share the panel through a `'static`
//! `RefCell<Ui>`. They never race for it: `TouchPresence::request` is *synchronous*
//! (the applet call chain is), so while it block-waits a tap the thread executor is
//! occupied and `status_task` cannot run — exactly like the BOOTSEL wait. USB on
//! the interrupt executor preempts the busy-wait throughout, so keepalives keep
//! flowing and a full-frame repaint never stalls enumeration.
