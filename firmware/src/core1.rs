//! The RP2350's second core as a prime-search engine for RSA keygen.
//!
//! RSA generation is the longest operation the device ever runs (each prime is
//! hundreds of rejected candidates), and the search is embarrassingly
//! parallel: candidates are independent random draws. Core1 runs a bare loop —
//! no executor: it sleeps in WFE until core0 posts a job, then draws and tests
//! candidates with its own per-job HMAC-DRBG, posting found primes back.
//! Core0 keeps testing its own candidates between polls and feeds both streams
//! through one [`RsaKeygen`] pool, so the cores race for `p` and `q` — the
//! expected wall time roughly halves (and with it the longest CCID transaction
//! a host ever has to sit through).
//!
//! Safety boundaries:
//! - **Flash/XIP**: embassy-rp's flash driver brackets every erase/program
//!   with `multicore::pause_core1()` (a RAM-resident FIFO-IRQ handshake), so
//!   this loop's XIP fetches can never collide with a flash write. The
//!   inter-core FIFO stays reserved for that protocol — this mailbox is
//!   critical-section statics plus SEV/WFE.
//! - **Heap**: both cores allocate bignums; the global allocator is
//!   critical-section-guarded (a cross-core hardware spinlock), so
//!   allocations serialize.
//! - **Secrets**: the DRBG seed and every prime in transit are zeroized at
//!   each hand-off, and `BUSY` is raised in the same critical section that
//!   takes the job — `run_rsa_search`'s wind-down ("job gone ∧ ¬BUSY ⇒ core1
//!   is out, nothing more will be posted") has no window for a late find.
